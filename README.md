# geofileops
Library to make spatial operations on large geo files fast(er) and easy.

Remarks: 
* Most typical operations are available: buffer, simplify, dissolve, union, erase, intersect,...
* Only/mainly faster on large files and for CPU intensive operations (eg. overlays). The more available cores, the faster. 
* Tested on geopackage and shapefile input files.
