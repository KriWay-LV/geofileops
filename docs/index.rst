GeofileOps |version|
====================

This python library makes spatial operations on geo files fast and easy. 

It provides an easy to use API and mainly for large files, all geospatial 
operations become a lot faster, because all available cores can be used.

Most typical operations are available: buffer, simplify, dissolve, union, 
erase, intersect,...
Tested on geopackage and shapefile input files.
